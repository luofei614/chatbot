Providence, Rhode Island Once Had a Team. The NBA first came to be as the Basketball Association of America in 1946, and one of the teams was called the Providence Steamrollers. This squad lasted a total of three seasons, putting together a cumulative record of 46-122.\

The Raptors Weren't Toronto's First Basketball Team\
Believe it or not, the Raptors and then-Vancouver Grizzlies weren't the first NBA teams to tip off north of the border. That honor belongs to the Toronto Huskies, one of the first teams in the league.\
However, at that point, Canada proved to be a tough basketball market as the Huskies lasted just one season, going 22-38 and missing the playoffs.\

Muggsy Bogues Was a First-Round Pick\
At 5'3", Muggsy Bogues is the smallest player to ever play in the NBA. Seeing as how he averaged just 8.3 points and 6.6 assists in four years at Wake Forest, one wouldn't think he was a first-round pick.\
One would be wrong, as the Washington Bullets selected the diminutive point guard with the 12th overall pick in the 1987 draft. He would go on to have a 14-year career, making his bones as a defensive threat and a decent passer. In terms of scoring, he only averaged 10-plus points three times.\
Still, he became something of a folk hero with his height, and has many fans to this day.\

Robert Parish Averaged Under 20 Points Per Game for His Career\
Robert Parish is easily one of the greatest centers to ever play the game. A seven-footer, he won four championship rings (three with the Boston Celtics, one with the Chicago Bulls) and played in nine All-Star games during his 21-year career.\
That said, one would think that his numbers were off the charts being a member of the dominant Celtics teams of the 1980s. Rather, Parish was not really a dominant scoring center. In fact, he averaged higher than 18 points five times.\
Given that, Parish finished his career with a fairly...well, average career average of 14.5 points per game.\

Chris Webber Never Played One Game for the Team That Drafted Him\
As a member of the University of Michigan's "Fab Five," Chris Webber was an absolute stud on the court. In two years with the Wolverines, he averaged 17.4 points and 10 rebounds per game.\
# ===\
Sure enough, the Orlando Magic took him with the first overall pick in the 1993 NBA draft and immediately traded him to the Golden State Warriors for Anfernee "Penny" Hardaway. Not many people know that the Warriors didn't draft the future Hall of Famer.\

Shaquille O'Neal Had a Rap Hit\
I'm not ashamed to admit that when I was playing playground basketball, this song would be playing in my head while I took my shots. Listen and laugh, folks.\

Dave DeBusschere Played Professional Baseball\
Dave DeBusschere may be best known as one of the best forwards of his generation, finishing his 12-year career with averages of 16.1 points and 11 rebounds per game. However, Deion Sanders better move over. DeBusschere was also a two-sport athlete who spent two seasons in Major League Baseball as well.\
A pitcher with the Chicago White Sox, DeBusschere spent two years with the team. Over that stretch, he went 3-4 with a 2.90 ERA and 1.38 WHIP.\
Now we know why he switched to basketball, I guess...\

Ray Allen's Real First Name Is Walter\
Seriously, who knew? Then again, can we blame him after the emergence of this guy?\

Pau Gasol Went to Medical School\
Gasol's face says it all in this picture.\
"I could have been a doctor, and now I'm stuck in Los Angeles sharing the ball with an egomaniac named Kobe. }
